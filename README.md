## Weather project
Welcome to my first personal end-to-end project. The goal of this project is to utilize and integrate the diverse tools I have been learning the last months. 
For this project I will use Python, SQL, Azure Databases and PowerBI. I will create my own database from scratch using SQL and populate it with data extracted from a KNMI weather api and connect to my Azure DB via PowerBI and create a report.
